                                            <p>People take drugs for lots of reasons. Having a better idea of why your friend takes drugs will help you when you talk to them.</p>
                                            <h3 id="to-socialise">To socialise</h3>
                                            <p>Some people take drugs occasionally to have fun, socialise and relax. Taking drugs might not become a problem for these people, and they’ll probably stop when they’re ready to. You can still remind your friend that some drugs are illegal and can affect their physical and mental health, especially if they’re still growing. </p>
                                            <h3 id="to-escape-">To ‘escape’</h3>
                                            <p>Some people use drugs to escape difficult feelings that they &#39;re struggling to cope with. They might be depressed, anxious or insecure, and they might think the drugs are helping them - when they’re actually making things worse. If you think this is the case, talk calmly to your friend and look for ways to help them think about why they &#39;re using drugs and ways they can manage without them. If necessary, suggest that they look for professional help. </p>
                                            <h3 id="to-fit-in">To fit in</h3>
                                            <p>Some people take drugs to fit in, or because they’re under pressure to do so by their friends. You could offer to do things with them that don’t involve using drugs.</p>
                                            <h3 id="to-experiment">To experiment</h3>
                                            <p>Some people are just curious. They might try drugs once or twice to see what it’s like and then decide to leave it. Remember that most people who try drugs don’t continue using them.</p>

                                            <p>Start by encouraging your friend to stay away from the places where they’d normally take drugs (like the pub or a mate’s house), and suggest other activities. </p>

Whatever happens, make sure your friend knows you’re around and happy to talk – that you’re there to help and not judge.  </p>

                                            <p>Most people only develop an addiction (or psychological dependence) after regularly taking a drug. It’s highly unlikely that anyone will develop an addiction after taking drugs once or twice – or from drinking once or twice.</p>
                                            <p>Some signs that a person is getting addicted to alcohol or drugs are:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>they take the drug very regularly or drink very regularly </li>
                                                <li>they take it despite trying to cut down or stop</li>
                                                <li>they lie about how much they take or take it in secret </li>
                                                <li>they keep taking it despite the harm it &#39;s causing </li>
                                                <li>they drink or take drugs alone </li>
                                                <li>they do extreme things to get the drug or alcohol – like stealing, getting into debt or faking symptoms to get prescription drugs</li>
                                                <li>they do less of the things they enjoy, because the drugs or alcohol are getting in the way </li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p>Remember that people who are addicted (or dependent) often don’t think they are, or don’t feel like they can admit it. </p>
                                            <p>So if you think your friend has a problem and you want to help them, think about how you &#39;re going to approach the topic and what you’re going to say – as you don’t want to upset them. </p>
                                            <p>And if they don’t listen to you at first, don’t be put off. Just give them some space and try again in a little while.</p>

                                            <p>It’s hard to tell what the effects of taking drugs are. Most people who try drugs don’t keep on using – and some people take drugs regularly without developing a problem. </p>
                                            <p>It all depends on who’s taking them, the person’s state of mind, which drug(s) they’re taking, what they’re mixing it with and where it’s being taken.</p>

                                            <p>Taking drugs can make users feel tired and run down. Sometimes people get more spots and colds too. If someone starts using drugs regularly, the harms can begin to build up resulting in long term health problems, such as liver, kidney and nerve damage.  </p>

                                            <p>Drug use can lead to people feeling unusually emotional with mood swings. Sometimes there can be serious mental health problems such as panic attacks and depression. Anybody with a family history of mental health issues should be especially careful when taking drugs as they may be more at risk themselves. </p>

                                            <p>Anyone can overdose from taking drugs, even if they are experienced at using drugs and think they know what they’re doing. Young people who are fit and healthy have died from a heart attack after taking drugs because of the toxic effects drugs can put on the body.</p>

                                            <p>Some people take drugs because it makes them less inhibited – but this can have negative effects too. They might do things they wouldn’t normally do that they later regret, like having unprotected sex. If your friend is out of it or having a bad experience on drugs, they’ll be vulnerable and may need help and looking after.</p>

                                            <p>Some drugs aren’t necessarily expensive, but frequent use can still get people into debt and financial trouble.</p>

Sometimes people get more spots and colds too. If someone starts using drugs regularly, the harms can begin to build up resulting in long term health problems, such as liver, kidney and nerve damage.  </p>\n<h3 id=\"mental-health-effects\">Mental health effects</h3>\n<p>Drug use can lead to people feeling unusually emotional with mood swings. Sometimes there can be serious mental health problems such as panic attacks and depression. Anybody with a family history of mental health issues should be especially careful when taking drugs as they may be more at risk themselves. </p>\n<h3 id=\"overdose\">Overdose</h3>\n<p>Anyone can overdose from taking drugs, even if they are experienced at using drugs and think they know what they’re doing. Young people who are fit and healthy have died from a heart attack after taking drugs because of the toxic effects drugs can put on the body.</p>\n<h3 id=\"acting-out-of-character-personal-safety\">Acting out of character &amp; personal safety</h3>\n<p>Some people take drugs because it makes them less inhibited – but this can have negative effects too.
